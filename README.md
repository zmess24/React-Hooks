# React Hooks 

### Purpose

This is a test [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) repo for experiementing with React Hooks, which is a new feature set of the react@16.7.0-alpha API.

### Current Projects

This application currently has two projects:

1. A basic counter that leverages state to increment by 1.
2. A Todo List.

### Next Steps.

Future plans to continue gaining experience with the API include:

* Using `useEffect()` for componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, ect.
* Using `useContext()`.
* Sharing state across mulitple components (redux?).

2. Navigate into the cloned repo and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
